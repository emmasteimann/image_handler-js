# Task 1:
Write a function to print out the separate RGB values for each pixel in image1.


# Task 2:
Write a function which takes image1 and returns a copy rotated 90 degrees clockwise.

# Task 3:
Write a function with the signature: (image1, image2, merge_amount), which returns an object
in the format above with each pixel of image1 and image2 merged according to merge amount, such that
merge_amount=0 is all image1, merge_amount=1 is all image2 and merge_amount=0.5 is a 50% mix of the two images.
